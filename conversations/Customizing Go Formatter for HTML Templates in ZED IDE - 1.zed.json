However, this might not directly support HTML formatting within `.a-h` files.\n\n6. **Manual Editing**:\n   - For simpler cases, consider manually editing your `.a-h` files to ensure they follow your formatting preferences before running any formatter.\n   \n7. **Check for Specific Tools or Extensions**:\n   Look for third-party tools or extensions that specifically target Go with HTML support in Zed.\n\nIf the default formatter settings in Zed do not allow for preservation of empty lines between HTML tags, a custom script tailored to these requirements might be necessary.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":89}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":83},"start":196,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":90}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":84},"start":2176,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":91}}}],"summary":"Customizing Go Formatter for HTML Templates in ZED IDE","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}],"thought_process_output_sections":[]}
