However, there is a key difference between them:\n\n1. **%v**:\n   - This verb prints a value in its default format.\n   - For built-in types like integers, floating-point numbers, strings, etc., it prints their usual textual representation.\n   - For user-defined types, `%v` usually prints the result of calling `String()` method if one is defined. If no such method exists, it falls back to printing the value in a compact form.\n\n2. **%+v**:\n   - This verb also prints the value in a human-readable format, but with additional information for complex types.\n   - For structs, it includes the field names along with their values.\n   - For slices and maps, it displays the elements inside them.\n   - For other user-defined types that implement the `fmt.Stringer` interface, `%+v` calls the `String()` method just like `%v`.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate the difference:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\n\ntype Person struct {\n\tName string\n\tAge  int\n}\n\nfunc (p Person) String() string {\n\treturn fmt.Sprintf(\"Person(Name=%s, Age=%d)\", p.Name, p.Age)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tp := Person{Name: \"Alice\", Age: 30}\n\n\tfmt.Printf(\"%v\\n\", p)  // Output: Person(Name=Alice, Age=30) (calls String() method)\n\tfmt.Printf(\"%+v\\n\", p) // Output: {Name:Alice Age:30} (prints field names and values)\n}\n```\n\nIn summary:\n- `%v` prints a value in its default format.\n- `%+v` provides more detailed, human-readable output for complex types.\n\nThis distinction is particularly useful when you want to debug or log the state of your data structures in a clear and informative manner.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":40}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":34},"start":58,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":41}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":35},"start":1739,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":42}}}],"summary":"%#v vs %+v In GoLang","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}],"thought_process_output_sections":[]}
